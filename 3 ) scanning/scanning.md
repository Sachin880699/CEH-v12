# 1 ) Scanningg

Network scanningis a method of getting network information such as identifiatio of host,port information, and services by scannig networks and ports

The main ojective of network scanning

1 ) To identify live host on a network
2 ) To identify open & closed port
3 ) To identify operation system information
4 ) To identify services running on a nework
5 ) To identify running process on a network

# TCP Communication

1 ) TCP - Transmission control Protocol
2 ) UDP - User Datagram Protocol

1 ) TCP is connecction oriented - once a connection is established data can be sent bidirectional

2 ) UDP is a simpler, connecctionless internett protocol. Multiple message are ent as packets in chunks using UDP
